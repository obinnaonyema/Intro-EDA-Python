# Overview
This is a set of tutorial materials I put together to guide beginners on the process of exploratory data analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis is a process to perform initial investigations on a data set so as to discover patterns, spot anomalies or validate assumptions.

In this process, an analyst relies on summary statistics and visualizations.

Important skills for conducting EDA with python include knowledge of python scripting, pandas and visualizations using matplotlib and/or seaborn
